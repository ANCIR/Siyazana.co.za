# connectedAFRICA

**Note:** This repository will eventually need to be renamed, as it currently holds a as-yet-unnamed joint project between ANCIR and the Institute for Security Studies. The project will serve as a prototype for connectedAFRICA infrastructure in the longer term.

This project maps out connections between politically exposed persons, business and other organisations in South Africa.

This package works in combination with a running instance of [grano](http://granoproject.org), a toolkit for journalistic influence mapping. Based on that API, this package provides ETL/loading scripts and a Flask-based frontend.
