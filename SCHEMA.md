This document collects requirements for the schema definition of
connectedAfrica. Our goal is to find a set of high-level relation
types and entity types that might cover the domains tracked in 
the system without needing to create new relation types for each
individual dataset that will be imported.

## Relation types 


What are the existing relations we're importing: 

* A is involved in a legal case B
* A is a registered officer at NPO B
* A is a member of B, holding a role (e.g. members of parliament;
  parties)
* A has a regulatory role wrt B (e.g. JSE auditor)
* A is a director of B
* A holds shares in B
