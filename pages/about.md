Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Damage report! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? I am your worst nightmare! Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Worf, It's better than music.

It's jazz. You enjoyed that. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. I'll be sure to note that in my log. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Sorry, Data. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. How long can two people talk about nothing? Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp.

I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Talk about going nowhere fast. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf.

Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet.
